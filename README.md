# jewelry-store-database
The company was unorganized in its database management, collecting data with a MS Access .mdb file to catalog for reference. Streamlining of the database would improve efficiency, by identifying product velocity, and thereby predicting when new stock needs to be ordered. Simplifying item search by compiling a product key database would allow for items to be identified in the system more quickly. Additionally, a database would also help query interesting business findings- such as Top Category sales, Top Salesmen and Seasonality trends.
The database is still managed at a basic level; no relationships have been defined, and the tables are not linked to automatically update the data. So, if a change is required, it must be manually updated in all tables from the access front end, which is time-consuming work.
The client conveyed a need to clean the data and extract the tables needed to build a database for an executive overview. Currently, the client has several unconnected but interdependent databases, attempting to create an efficient model that is effective and compatible with all required entities. If the data allows for forecasting missing business/sales, the client can better manage their resources.
